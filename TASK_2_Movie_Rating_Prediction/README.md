# Movie Rating Prediction – CODSOFT Task 2

This project predicts movie ratings using machine learning models based on features such as year, duration, votes, genre, director, and main actors. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed before training Linear Regression and Random Forest models. The notebook also includes a manual input section where users can enter movie details to get a predicted rating.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory data analysis  
- OneHotEncoding for categorical features  
- Model training (Linear Regression, Random Forest)  
- Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²  
- Manual rating prediction for any movie  

## How to Use
1. Upload the dataset (`IMDb Movies India.csv`)  
2. Run the notebook (`CODSOFT_Task2_Movie_Rating_Prediction.ipynb`)  
3. Enter movie details when prompted to get the predicted rating
