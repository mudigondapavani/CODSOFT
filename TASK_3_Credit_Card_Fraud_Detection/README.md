# Credit Card Fraud Detection – CODSOFT Task 3

This project detects credit card fraud using machine learning models. The dataset is preprocessed, scaled, and balanced using SMOTE before training Logistic Regression and Random Forest models. The notebook also includes a manual input section where users can enter transaction details to get a fraud prediction.

## Features
- Data inspection and preprocessing  
- Handling class imbalance with SMOTE  
- Feature scaling  
- Model training (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)  
- Evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix  
- Manual fraud prediction for any transaction  

## How to Use
1. Upload the dataset (`creditcard.csv`) 
   Source: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset  
 2. Run the notebook (`CODSOFT_Task3_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb`)  
3. Enter transaction `Time` and `Amount` when prompted to get fraud prediction  

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
